# Nexora Tool Bot

A Telegram bot that bundles a growing collection of self-hosted utility
tools behind one bot. It runs on your own Android phone via Termux — no
rented server needed.

**Available tools:**

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🎬 **Nexo Link2video** | Send a YouTube, YouTube Shorts, Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, Facebook, or Reddit video link and get it back as MP4 (video) or MP3 (audio), in a quality you choose. |

More tools are on the way — see [Roadmap](#roadmap-planned-tools) below.

---

## 1. Install Termux on your phone

Don't use the Play Store version — it's outdated and broken for this use case.
Install from **F-Droid** instead:

1. Open your phone's browser and go to `f-droid.org`
2. Download and install the F-Droid app (your phone will warn about
   "installing unknown apps" — allow it for your browser just for this)
3. Open F-Droid, search for **Termux**, and install it
4. In F-Droid, also search for and install **Termux:Boot** and
   **Termux:API** (same publisher — needed later for auto-start and battery
   control)

## 2. Stop Android from killing the bot in the background

Android aggressively kills background apps to save battery, which would stop
the bot. Do this once:

1. **Settings → Apps → Termux → Battery** → set to **Unrestricted**
2. **Settings → Apps → Termux:Boot → Battery** → set to **Unrestricted**
3. **Settings → Battery → Battery optimization** → find Termux → **Don't optimize**
4. Open Termux, swipe it into your **Recent Apps** tray, and tap the pin/lock
   icon so a "clear all" swipe doesn't kill it

(No root required for any of this.)

## 3. Get a bot token from Telegram

1. In Telegram, search for **@BotFather** (the official one, verified checkmark)
2. Send it `/newbot`
3. Give it a display name — e.g. `Nexora Tool Bot` — then a username ending
   in `bot` (e.g. `nexora_tool_bot`)
4. BotFather replies with a token like `7123456789:AAHxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   — copy it, you'll need it in step 5. **Keep it private** — anyone with it
   can control your bot.

The bot also sets its own display name to "Nexora Tool Bot" automatically on
startup via the Telegram API, so it'll show that name even if you picked
something else with BotFather.

## 4. Clone and set up the bot

Open Termux and run:

```bash
pkg install -y git
git clone https://github.com/aatef14/nexora-tool-bot.git
cd nexora-tool-bot
bash setup.sh
```

`setup.sh` installs Python, Node, ffmpeg, and all Python dependencies, sets
up storage access, and configures auto-start on reboot.

## 5. Add your bot token

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Set `BOT_TOKEN=` to the token from step 3. Save with `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, then
exit with `Ctrl+X`.

## 6. (Recommended) Lock the bot to just you

By default, **anyone who finds your bot's username on Telegram can use it**
— usernames are public and searchable. See [Whitelisting](#whitelisting-restricting-who-can-use-the-bot)
below to restrict it to yourself before going further. The whitelist applies
to every tool in the bot, not just one.

## 7. Run it

```bash
bash bot-start.sh
```

This starts the bot in the background — it keeps running even if you close
Termux. You'll see:
```
Bot started in the background.
View live messages with: bash bot-logs.sh
Stop it with:            bash bot-stop.sh
```

Then in Telegram, open a chat with your bot and send `/start`, then `/tools`
to see the list of available tools — each one has its own command (e.g.
`/link2video`) that shows how to use it.

**Managing the bot going forward:**

| Action | Command |
|---|---|
| Start the bot | `bash bot-start.sh` |
| Watch live activity/logs | `bash bot-logs.sh` (Ctrl+C stops watching, not the bot) |
| Stop the bot | `bash bot-stop.sh` |
| Debug a startup failure | `bash bot-debug.sh` |

If `bash bot-start.sh` reports "Bot failed to start", or the bot just doesn't
seem to respond, run `bash bot-debug.sh` instead — it runs the bot in the
foreground (not backgrounded) so the actual error is printed directly to
your screen instead of only going to `bot.log`. Stop it with `Ctrl+C` once
you've seen the error.

Reboot your phone once after setup — Termux:Boot will auto-start the bot
from then on, so it comes back automatically after a restart or crash.

## Project structure

```
nexora-tool-bot/
├── bot.py            # Core: startup, /start, /id, dispatches to tools, housekeeping
├── webui.py           # Optional local admin web panel
├── core/
│   └── access.py       # Shared whitelist check, used by every tool
└── tools/
    ├── __init__.py     # TOOLS registry — add new tools here
    └── link2video.py   # Nexo Link2video: the video/audio downloader
```

Each tool is a self-contained module under `tools/` exposing a `NAME`,
`COMMAND`, `SUMMARY`, and a `register(app)` function that wires up its own
Telegram command (e.g. `/link2video`) and handlers. Adding a new tool means
writing one new file and adding it to the `TOOLS` list in
[`tools/__init__.py`](tools/__init__.py) — the `/tools` menu, the bot's
command list, and its description all pick it up automatically.

---

## Using a tool: /tools and per-tool commands

- `/start` — a one-line intro to the bot
- `/tools` — lists every tool currently installed, with its command
- `/link2video` — shows usage instructions for Nexo Link2video specifically

You don't actually need to run a tool's command to use it — for
Nexo Link2video, just paste a supported link and the bot picks it up
automatically. The command is there mainly so `/tools` has something to
point at, and so you get a reminder of how that tool works.

### Nexo Link2video: choosing MP4/MP3 and quality

Send any supported video link. The bot detects which platform it's from and
asks you to pick a format:

```
Detected: YouTube
Choose a format:
[ 🎬 MP4 (video) ]  [ 🎵 MP3 (audio) ]
```

Then a quality menu appears:
- **MP4**: Best available, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p
- **MP3**: 320 kbps, 192 kbps, 128 kbps

Tap one, and the bot downloads and sends the file back with the title,
uploader, and duration as the caption.

---

## Optional: Nexora Tool Bot Admin Portal (web control panel)

Instead of typing `bot-start.sh`/`bot-stop.sh`/`bot-logs.sh` in Termux, you
can run the **Admin Portal** — a small web dashboard on your phone with
Start/Stop/Restart buttons, whitelist management, and a live log view:

```bash
bash web-start.sh
```

Then open **http://localhost:8080** in your phone's own browser (Chrome,
Firefox, whatever). It's not a separate app — it's a small Python web
server (Flask) running inside Termux, same as the bot itself.

Stop it with:
```bash
bash web-stop.sh
```

**Security note:** by default it only binds to `127.0.0.1`, so only your
phone's own browser can reach it. If you set `WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0` in `.env`
to access it from another device on the same WiFi (e.g. a laptop), you
**must** also set `WEBUI_PASSWORD` — otherwise anyone on your network could
start/stop your bot.

---

## Whitelisting: restricting who can use the bot

Telegram bots are public by default — anyone who finds the username can
message it and use your phone's bandwidth/battery/storage. To restrict it to
yourself (or a few trusted people), for **all tools at once**:

1. Have the person message your bot with `/id` — it replies with their
   numeric Telegram user ID (e.g. `123456789`) and their username
2. They send you that ID
3. Open the **Admin Portal** (`bash web-start.sh`, then `http://localhost:8080`)
   and add it under **Whitelist** — type the ID, optionally a name to
   label it (e.g. "Atif"), and tap **Add**. The bot restarts automatically
   to apply it.

Prefer the terminal? You can edit `.env` directly instead:
```bash
nano .env
```
Set `ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789` (your ID), optionally with a name:
`ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789:Atif`. Comma-separate more entries:
`ALLOWED_USER_IDS=123456789:Atif,987654321:Sam`. Then restart:
`bash bot-stop.sh && bash bot-start.sh`

Anyone whose ID isn't in that list gets "This bot is private." instead of a
response, with instructions to send `/id` and pass it to you. Leaving
`ALLOWED_USER_IDS` blank allows anyone to use the bot.

## Roadmap (planned tools)

Ideas for future additions — each would land as its own module under
`tools/`, following the same pattern as Nexo Link2video:

- **Nexo Image** — compress, resize, convert, or strip EXIF from photos
- **Nexo PDF** — merge/split PDFs, convert images ↔ PDF, extract text
- **Nexo OCR** — extract text from a photo (receipts, screenshots, signs)
- **Nexo QR** — generate a QR code from text/a link, or decode one from a photo
- **Nexo Translate** — translate a message or forwarded text between languages
- **Nexo Notes** — quick personal notes/reminders stored per user
- **Nexo Convert** — unit and currency conversion
- **Nexo Shorten** — turn a long URL into a short one (self-hosted)
- **Nexo Sticker** — turn a photo into a Telegram sticker
- **Nexo FileConvert** — convert between file formats:
  - **Images**: JPG, PNG, WEBP, BMP, GIF, HEIC (Pillow — cheap, no extra system deps)
  - **Audio**: MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, FLAC (ffmpeg — already installed for Nexo Link2video)
  - **Video**: MP4, AVI, MKV, WEBM, MOV, animated GIF (ffmpeg — same as above)
  - **Data**: CSV ↔ JSON ↔ XLSX (pandas/openpyxl — cheap)
  - **Archives**: ZIP ↔ 7Z/RAR extraction and repacking (py7zr/rarfile)
  - **Documents**: DOCX/PPTX/XLSX ↔ PDF, HTML ↔ PDF, Markdown ↔ PDF (needs a
    headless LibreOffice or a rendering engine — heavier to install on a
    phone than the categories above, so this would ship later as an
    optional add-on rather than in the first version)

Have a tool you want prioritized, or one to suggest that isn't listed? Open
an issue on the repo.

## Notes

- Telegram's standard Bot API caps uploads at 50MB (`MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` in
  `.env`). To send larger files you'd need to run your own local Bot API
  server with credentials from https://my.telegram.org — not covered here.
- Instagram often rate-limits anonymous requests. If Nexo Link2video
  downloads start failing, export cookies from a logged-in browser session
  and point `INSTAGRAM_COOKIES_FILE` at that file in `.env`.
- Logs are written to `bot.log` in the project folder; it's automatically
  truncated once it exceeds `MAX_LOG_SIZE_MB` (default 20MB) so it won't
  fill up your storage.
- Leftover temp files from any crashed download are swept daily and on
  every startup, so normal use won't accumulate storage over time.
